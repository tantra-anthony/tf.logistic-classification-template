# IMPLICATIONS FROM TRAINING SET
# points on the graph shows all the data points for the TRAINING SET
# each user is characterised by age and salary (x and y axis resp)
# red ones are training observations where purchased = 0
# green ones is 1
# people with higher salaries are predicted to buy the SUV
# older people are predicted to buy the SUV (probably because of savings?)
# goal is to classify the right users to the right category
# the two categories are yes or no to buying the SUV
# prediction regions (red and green) represent the classifications
# thus implication is that the company can target the ads more towards the 
# green region
# straight line is called the "prediction boundary"
# the fact that it is a straight line is because the logistic regression classifier
# is linear as we set it previously
# in 3D comparatively it's going to be a plane separating 2 3D spaces
# if we build a Non-Linear Classifier, then the prediction boundary will not
# be a straight line
# the randomness of data and the fact that we're using only a linear separator
# there are still quite a lot of errors
